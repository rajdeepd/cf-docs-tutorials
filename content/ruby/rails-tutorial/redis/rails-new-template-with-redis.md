##Introduction

This section introduces the Expense Report application. It teaches you how to get started with a new Rails application with Redis and some other required configurations for the application.

##Prerequisites

+ [Ruby and Rails](http://docs/cloudfoundry.com/frameworks/ruby/installing-ruby.html) installed on your machine.
+ [Redis](http://redis.io/download) installed on your machine.

Starting a new application in Rails is as simple as executing a single command `rails new <appname>`.

Before we start on the new application, let us go through the application overview.

##Subtopics

+ [Creating a new template with Redis](#creating-new-template-with-redis)
+ [Configuring the application](#configuring-the-application)

##Expense Report application overview

This application helps users in maintaining a record of their expenses.

High-Level overview of Expense Report Application:

In this application, the users can keep track of their expenses by creating, updating and deleting expenses.

In short,

+ Users will be able to see all expense reports created along with amount, expense type and date of expense.

+ They will be allowed to create a new expense report.

+ Users will be able to see the list all expense reports.

##Creating New Template with Redis

Running an application in Ruby on Rails depends on the versions of Ruby and Rails in which the application has been developed. First decide the versions of both Ruby and Rails.

For now, CloudFoundry supports two versions of Ruby:-

+ ruby1.8.7
+ ruby1.9.2-p180.

This tutorial is based on the version 1.9.2-p180. For Rails use 3.2 .

Install Ruby through `rvm`, a version management for ruby. And choose the Ruby version by following this command.

```bash
$ rvm use 1.9.2-p180
```

`rvm` offeres a good mechanism called `gemset` for handling gems and their dependencies for particular Ruby versions. Create a separate gemset for the Expense Report application.

```bash
$ rvm gemset use expense_report --create
```

This command will create the expense_report gemset if it isn't existing and in use already. Now, install Rails gem to be able to genarate a new rails application. Use the following command for installing it

```bash
$ gem install rails
```
This will install the latest version of Rails.

This tutorial chooses Redis as the database. Generate the new application without any database by providing the option as `--skip-active-record`

```bash
$ rails new rails-expense-report-redis --skip-active-record
```

This will create a new application without any database configuration and also finish bundle installation.

 Next, go to the application folder.

```bash

$ cd rails-expense-report-redis

```

##Check Point

Start the server by following command.

```bash
$ rails s
```

The server runs on port 3000. Open your browser and go to the url [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The Index page will now be visible

##Configuring the application

Creating a file with name .rvmrc will tell the rvm to use a particular Ruby version and gemset whenever you enter the application folder through the terminal. Place a file named .rvmrc in the main folder and write the following line in.

```ruby
rvm use 1.9.2-p180@expense_report --create
```

###Removing the default index.html page

Remove the `public/index.html` page which will be rendered when you start the application in browser.

```bash
$ rm public/index.html
```

###Gemfile

Bundler is a tool that maintains a consistent environment for a developerâ€™s code across all machines. Know more about bundler [here](http://gembundler.com/).
Gemfile is the place where all the gems that are used in the application can be placed. Bundler will install all the gems that are mentioned in the Gemfile along with their dependencies.
In the gem file, replace the `jquery-rails` gem with `cloudfoundry-jquery-rails` and add a gem `ohm`.

Ohm is a library that allows to store an object in Redis, a persistent key-value database. It includes an extensible list of validations and has very good performance.
Now the Gemfile will look like below:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'rails', '3.2.9'
gem 'ohm'

group :assets do
  gem 'sass-rails',   '~> 3.2.3'
  gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 3.2.1'
  gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.0.3'
end

# gem 'therubyracer'

# gem 'jquery-rails'
gem 'cloudfoundry-jquery-rails'
```

Use the gem `therubyracer` if you do not have javascript environment in your system. This will be useful for the assets. To install javascript runtime, install node.js by following [these instructions](http://howtonode.org/how-to-install-nodejs).

Install all the gems by running the following command.

```bash
$ bundle install
```

##Configuring the database

Before doing any redis configuration in the application make sure that you have already installed Redis in your local machine. You can [follow this](http://redis.io/download) to install Redis.
For this application we dont require any `config/database.yml` file. All the attributes and relationship can be defined inside the model only.
For database storage we will use `ohm` gem. Ohm is a library that allows to store an object in Redis, a persistent key-value database. It includes an extensible list of validations and has very good performance.

##Adding Styles to the application

Here we have a customised UI for this Expense Report application. To use these styles, add the css file into your `app/assets/stylesheets` folder. [Get the the CSS files from here](/rails-code/stylesheets-redis.zip)

After adding the css files, [get the images from here](/rails-code/ui-images-redis.zip) and place them in your `app/assets/images` folder.

In `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` remove all the content and add the following lines:

```rhtml
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Expense Report</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag "application", :media => "all" %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag "application" %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>
<div id="contentWrapper">
  <div class="blue-b">
    <%= render :partial => "layouts/header_nav" %>
  </div>
  <div class="mc-a">
    <%= yield %>
  </div>
</div>
</body>
</html>

```

In the above `application.html.erb` file we have rendered a partial `layout/header_nav`, hence we need to create `_header_nav.html.erb` file inside `app/views/layouts`.
In `_header_nav.html.erb` file add the following lines:

```rhtml
<div class="inside-nav">
  <div class="logo">
    <img src="<%= asset_path 'logo.png' %>">
  </div>
</div>

```


##Schema Design
Redis does not uses ActiveRecord for the query interface. We will be using `Ohm` as the ORM for redis in the rails application. Ohm is an Object-hash mapping library for Redis.There are not going to be any tables or columns or even application specific database. Redis will only store the key-value pair.
By default all the data is stored in `/var/lib/redis/6379/dump.rdb` file.

The application will deal with one Expense model.

```ruby
class Expense < Ohm::Model
  attribute :description
  attribute :amount
  attribute :status
  attribute :date
  attribute :expense_type

end
```

Here the attributes are like columns in the table.
